# Container Images, Where To Find Them and How To Build Them

## The Mighty Hub: Using Docker Hub Registry Images

http://hub.docker.com

docker image ls  -- List down all docker images downloaded locally

docker pull nginx  -- By default pulls the latest image

docker pull nginx:1.11.9  -- Specify the version of the image that we need

docker pull nginx:1.11

docker pull nginx:1.11.9-alpine

docker image ls

## Images and Their Layers: Discover the Image Cache

docker image ls

docker history nginx:latest  -- History of different layers to build this image

docker history mysql

docker image inspect nginx  -- Get details of every thing in an image

## Image Tagging and Pushing to Docker Hub

docker image tag -- help -- Use 2 arguments original tag and then new tag we want

docker image ls -- List down all images present

docker pull mysql/mysql-server -- Pull a different sql image and even this is stored locally

docker image ls

docker pull nginx:mainline -- pull a container with mainline as tag

docker image ls

docker image tag nginx anikur1993/nginx -- Create a new tag to push to dockerhub. Same nginx layer is used and extra space is needed

docker image tag --help

docker image ls -- My new container with userid/nginx tage is created with same ID as nginx

docker image push anikur1993/nginx -- Push the image to dockerhub

docker --help

docker login -- Login to dockerhub from terminal

cat .docker/config.json -- Use the auth key for login purpose(present in this file)

docker image push anikur1993/nginx

docker image tag bretfisher/nginx bretfisher/nginx:testing -- Tag and create a new tag as testing from same old tag

docker image ls --  we can see the new added tag(testing) in here along with previous one

docker image push bretfisher/nginx:testing -- We push this new tag with that image and in dockerhub we can see new tag called testing

docker image ls -- List down all docker images locally

## Building Images: The Dockerfile Basics

cd dockerfile-sample-1  -- Downloading a dockerfile

vim Dockerfile  -- Inspect subparts in the file(FROM, ENV, RUN, EXPOSE, CMD)

## Building Images: Running Docker Builds

docker image build -t customnginx .  -- Go to the folder where "Dockerfile" is present and then have this cmd, where -t gives tag name to image and . at the end tells the cmd to use the file present in the folder

docker image ls  -- U can see new created image in here

docker image build -t customnginx . -- Making some change to Dockerfile and then re-running uses cache until that changed line and then runs below lines (And so more changing code at the end and less changing at the top)

## Building Images: Extending Official Images

cd dockerfile-sample-2

vim Dockerfile  -- check this file, we use copy cmd to copy file from local to docker image

docker container run -p 80:80 --rm nginx

docker image build -t nginx-with-html .  -- builing an image using existing official and a new html file in the folder

docker container run -p 80:80 --rm nginx-with-html

docker image ls

docker image tag --help

docker image tag nginx-with-html:latest anikur1993/nginx-with-html:latest -- Giving the tag to the custom created image

docker image ls

docker push -- Pushing the image to the dockerhub

## Assignment Answers: Build Your Own Dockerfile and Run Containers From It

cd dockerfile-assignment-1

vim Dockerfile

docker build cmd

docker build -t testnode .

docker container run --rm -p 80:3000 testnode

docker images

docker tag --help

docker tag testnode bretfisher/testing-node

docker push --help

docker push bretfisher/testing-node

docker image ls

docker image rm bretfisher/testing-node

docker container run --rm -p 80:3000 bretfisher/testing-node
